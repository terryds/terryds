### Welcome to My Page!
  
Hi, I'm Terry Djony, from Indonesia.  

Here are some highlights about my life journey: 
- born and raised in Lampung (small city in Indonesia)
- self-taught coding at age 14, tinkering with bulletin boards, learning LAMP stack and their design patterns, published my first web components on packagist
- moved to Bandung for university study (at Bandung Institute of Technology)
- built my first company, a chatbot agency (https://chatbiz.id), during college year 3, **profitable from day one**
- dropped out of college to pursue tech entrepreneurship full-time
- got into YCombinator Batch W21 at age 21
- got into Global Shapers by WEF in 2021
- while still running chatbot agency, i'm also exploring new ideas to work with exciting AI technology
