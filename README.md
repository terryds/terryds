hi, i'm [Terry Djony](https://terrydjony.com/), from Indonesia.
<br />
here's something about my journey: 
- born and raised in Lampung (small city in Indonesia)
- self-taught coding at age 14, tinkering with bulletin boards, learning LAMP stack and their design patterns, published my first web components on packagist
- moved to Bandung for university study (at Bandung Institute of Technology)
- built my first company, a chatbot SaaS (https://chatbiz.id), during college year 3, 
- dropped out of college to pursue tech entrepreneurship full-time
- got into ycombinator at age 21
- got into Global Shapers by WEF in 2021
- chatbot SaaS becomes profitable and self-sustaining, yet failed to become the fast-growing potential unicorn
- pivoted to my second company, the first finance operations platform for money movements in SEA ( https://arbofinance.com )
- ..
